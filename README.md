# TableViewProject

1. I have added a tableView in the main storyboard. Add the delegate and datasource methods for this tableView and load the data you will find in the "elements" array.
1.1. Add a custom cell with name "CustomCalendarCell". It must contain an image and the month name. Look for any 12-free image in the internet and add them to the project.
2. When tapping in any cell, just open a second view with just a label in the center and the name of the tapped month on it. Must have a "back" button.
3. When you're done, just create a PR (Pull Request) with the changes to this repo.
